# Welcome to InstaPost

InstaPost is essentially a very basic Instagram clone that uses a custom Rails API for it's backend while using plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS for frontend. This web application allows its users to take URL's from other websites and set that to the database for it to be rendered onto the page as an image with a descript the users would like thus representing an instagram post. Commends may be added and deleted, along with the post deleted as well!
